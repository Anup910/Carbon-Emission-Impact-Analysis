# Carbon-Emission-Impact-Analysis

## Problem Statement:
Climate change, largely driven by increasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, poses a critical threat to global ecosystems and human societies. This study seeks to analyze the historical relationship between CO₂ concentrations and global temperature anomalies to identify long-term trends and key turning points. The objective is threefold:

(1) To examine how industrial and anthropogenic activities have influenced climate patterns over time,

(2) To detect significant anomalies that may indicate unusual natural or human-driven events, and

(3) To simulate future climate scenarios based on varying CO₂ emission trajectories. Through this comprehensive analysis, the study aims to generate actionable insights that can inform effective, data-driven policy decisions to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

## About the Dataset:
To support this analysis, two comprehensive datasets are utilized. The Annual Surface Temperature Change dataset captures temperature anomalies across various countries from 1960 to 2022, measured in degrees Celsius relative to a historical baseline. It offers annual observations, allowing a clear view of how global temperatures have evolved over time. Complementing this, the Monthly Atmospheric CO₂ Concentrations dataset provides monthly CO₂ measurements in parts per million (ppm) from 1958 to 2024, enabling detailed temporal insights into rising emission levels. Together, these datasets form a strong foundation for understanding historical climate trends, identifying anomalies, and simulating future scenarios to evaluate the impact of carbon emissions on global warming.
